# React Component Builder

Building React component scaffolding in a second.

## Why this project?

Even with code snippets and hotkey, building a new React component still cost you lots of time, especially when you use lots of libraries or patterns to construct complex web application.

For example, we use Immutable.js, Redux, and CSS Module in our projects. We usually need to include those libraries into our React components. However, putting all code of importing libraries into code snippets is also problematic too. We don't use all those libraries in every components. Therefore, we want to able to configure those code snippets, and build this helper UI interface.
